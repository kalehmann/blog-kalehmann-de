# My first trip to russia

In the fall of 2017 my cousin first started talking to me about traveling to
Moscow together. It started as a joke. But at the end of 2016 the plans started
to become more specific.

In the end it became a seven day trip in august 2017.

We started from Prague and flew directly to Moscow Sheretmetyevo International
Airport.

The outbound flight went a bit funny, since the plane was overbooked, we almost
had jump seats in the kitchen. In the end some other passengers did not arrive
and we got boring regular seats.

The city was a really different experience from everything I had seen yet.
Everywhere were really luxurious monuments, but on the other side the sort of
decayed residential blocks.

One of the first places we came across was the red quare besides the Lenin
Mausoleum and the Kremlin.

What impressed me most were all the beautiful and magnificent parks all around
the city.

The main portal of the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure, named after
the soviet writer Maxim Gorky:

A monument to honor the fallen soldiers of the first world war in front of the
victory park

Welcome at the Losiny Ostrov National Park, also called Elk Island. This is the
view out of the train station in the park, belokamennaya. We did not see any
elks, but their footsteps.

Kolomenskoye, a former royal estate in Moscow.

Another attraction we visited was the Ostakino Tower. This is the view from
over the city from the observation platform at about 350 metres above the ground.
