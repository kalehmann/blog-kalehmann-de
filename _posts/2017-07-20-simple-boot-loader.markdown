## SiBoLo - Writing a simple bootloader

### How it started

Writing bootcode using only the bios functions can be quite funny. Implementing
programs without loading additional data using only 512 bytes is a nice
challenge. However at some point comes the desire to do some more complex
things. That was the day when I decided to write a bootloader for fun.

There are a handful of points that I have considered before writing a
bootloader.

The main question is what do I want to load?
- A bunch of bytes from a fixed address at the drive?
- A file from a file system on the drive?

After answering that question I had to think about the design of the bootloader.
A bootloader can be single staged or multi staged.

Single staged means that all the magic fits into 512 bytes, the bootloader loads
the data directly.

For bootloaders, that have to do some more complex things, like handling user
input or supporting multiple file systems, 512 bytes are unsatisfactory.
A solution is a bootloader that consists of two stages. A big, bloated stage
that does all the file loading and a small stage that loads the second stage.
Such a bootloader is called a multi stage bootloader.

My decision fell to a bootloader that is able to load a file from a FAT12
formatted drive by its name. Since FAT12 is fairly simple, a single staged
bootloader is enough to meet these requirements.

The whole code was written during my first apprenticeship, most of it originated
during the daily train trips to school.

### The layout of a FAT12 formatted drive

Lets start with a little excursion about the layout of a FAT12 formatted
drive. A FAT12 formatted drive begins with the boot record. The boot record has
a fixed size of 512 bytes.

#### The Bios Parameter Block

The BPB is a structure in the boot record describing the drive and the file
system. The bootloader contains a DOS 4.0 Extended BPB with the following
data:

{% highlight nasm %}
;; 3 bytes for jump after the BPB
jmp short start
nop

OEMLabel:		db "mkfs.fat"
SectorSize:		dw 512
SectorsPerCluster:	db 1
ReservedForBoot:	dw 1
NumberOfFats:		db 2
NumberOfRootDirEntrys:	dw 224
LogicalSectors:		dw 2880
MediumByte:		db 0F0h
SectorsPerFat:		dw 9
SectorsPerTrack:	dw 18
NumberOfHeads:		dw 2
HiddenSectors:		dd 0
LargeSectors:		dd 0
DriveNumber:		dw 0
Signature:		db 41
VolumeID:		dd 0
VolumeLabel:		db "FatTest    "
FileSystem:		db "FAT12   "
{% endhighlight %}

The data in the BPB is essential information for loading additional code and
data from a drive.

#### The File Allocation Table

The boot record is followed by one or more file allocation tables. The file
allocation table describes the distribution of the files on the drive. The
FAT12 file system organizes the data on the drive in clusters. The size of
a cluster may be equal to the size of a sector, but a cluster can also span over
multiple sectors.

A File Allocation Table is a list of all the clusters on the drive. Each entry
contains either the index of the next cluster in the cluster chain for a file
or special markers indicating an empty cluster or the end of the cluster chain.

The first two entries in the file allocation table contain special values. The
first entry holds the fat id and the second entry holds the special marker
indicating the end of a cluster chain.

The **12** in FAT**12** describes the size of each entry in the file allocation
table, 12 bytes.

#### The root directory table

Directories are organized as tables on a FAT12 partition. All those tables are
organized as files on the drive except the root directory table. It starts right
after the file allocation table(s) and has a fixed number of entries. Each entry
has a size of 32 bytes and describes a file in the directory.

The entries have the following layout:

```
description                      | size
-------------------------------------------
short file name                  | 8 bytes
short file extension             | 3 bytes
file attributes                  | 1 byte
user attributes                  | 1 byte
creation time or first character | 1 byte
password hash or creation time   | 2 bytes
creation date                    | 2 bytes
owner id                         | 2 bytes
access rights                    | 2 bytes
last modification time           | 2 bytes
last modification date           | 2 bytes
first cluster                    | 2 bytes
file size                        | 4 bytes
```

### Implementing the bootloader

The bootloader has to complete several tasks to load and execute a program from
the drive:

- Relocate the bootloader that the program can be loaded to the the
memory address where the BIOS loads bootcode to. This is the address 0x7c00.
- Load the root directory table and find the entry for the file that should be
loaded.
- Follow the chain of entries in the file allocation table and load the file
into memory.
- Jump to the position where the file is loaded.
- A nice extra would be preserving the drive number of the boot drive and
passing it to the loaded program.

#### Relocation the program

The relocation is a pretty simple task. There is the **rep** instruction in x86
assembly. It repeats a string operation until the **cx** register equals zero.
In combination with the **movsw** instruction, which moves a single word
(two bytes) from **ds:si** to **es:di**, it can be used to copy any amount
of data around.

After that comes a far jump to the new location, that also changes the code
segment **cs**.

{% highlight nasm %}
  ;; Move 512 bytes form 0x7c00 to 0x600 and jump to the new address
  mov ax, 0x7c0
  mov ds, ax  
  mov ax, 0x60
  mov es, ax

  xor si, si
  xor di, di
  mov cx, 256
  rep movsw

  jmp 0x60:go_on
go_on:
{% endhighlight %}

#### Loading actual data from a drive

This is not quite so simple. The BIOS handles drives still as floppy like
devices.
Floppys had those thin magnet disks. Some disks were read- and writable and
both sides and others only at one. Reading and writing to such a disk happens
by the head over the disk. Therefore you can refer to a side of a specific disk
by the number of its head. The disk itself is split in many circular magnet
stripes called tracks for one or two heads and cylinders for more heads.
Furthermore a cylinder is split in several sectors, which are 1-indexed.

Therefore the cylinder, the head and the sector need to be known to address a
sector on a floppy. This is commonly referred to as _CHS_.
An alternative to this is the Logical Block Addressing - _LBA_. This is a
zero-indexed linear addressing scheme for sectors on a drive and a useful
abstraction.

However, most file systems including FAT do not think in sectors, but in
clusters. A cluster may be equal to one sector, but can also span over two or
more sectors.

This brings the need for some helper functions to get the cylinder, head and
sector from a cluster.

The LBA can be calculated from a cluster using the following formula (Note that
the cluster numbering starts at 2):

![LBA = (Cluster - 2) * SectorsPerCluster + RootStartSector + RootDirSize]({{ "assets/sibolo/lba.svg" | absolute_url }})

{% highlight nasm %}
%macro cluster2LBA 0
	;; This macro calculates the LBA from the cluster in ax and saves it in
	;; the ax register.
	;; Cluster numbering starts at 2, therefore first subtract 2 from the
	;; cluster number to get zero-based cluster numbers.
	;; LBA = Cluster * SectorsPerCluster + RootStartSector + RootSize
	sub ax, 2
	xor cx, cx
	mov cl, [SectorsPerCluster]
	mul cx
	add al, [RootStartSector]
	add ax, [RootSize]
%endmacro
{% endhighlight %}

From that the cylinder, head and sector can be calculated with

![cylinder = LBA / (SectorsPerTrack * NumberOfHeads); sector = LBA % SectorsPerTrack + 1; head = (LBA / SectorsPertrack) % NumberOfHeads]({{ "assets/sibolo/chs.svg" | absolute_url }})

{% highlight nasm %}
%macro lbachs 0
	;; This macro converts a LBA address stored in ax to a CHS address
	;; and saves the track/cylinder in the ch register, the sector in the
	;; cl register and the head in the dh register.
	xor dx, dx
	div word [SectorsPerTrack]
	;; ax -> lba / spt
	;; dx -> lba % spt
	inc dx
	;; sectors = lba mod spt + 1
	mov cl, dl
	xor dx, dx
	div word [NumberOfHeads]
	;; ax -> lba / (spt * heads)
	;; dx -> (lba / spt) % heads
	;; Save the head to dh
	mov dh, dl
	;; Save the cylinder to ch
	mov ch, al
%endmacro
{% endhighlight %}

With this knowledge a function that reads multiple sectors from a drive can be
implemented.

The data can be loaded using the interrupt 0x13,2. This interrupt takes
the number of sectors to read in **al**, the cylinder in the two most
significant bits of **cl** and **ch**, the head in **dh**, the drive number
in **dl** and a pointer to a buffer in **es:bx**.

An important thing to remember is that this interrupt sets the carry flag in
case of an error. This is important for reading from real floppies. Several
read attempts may be necessary to give the motor some time to reach the
required speed.

{% highlight nasm %}
readsectors:
	;; Read n sectors starting from LBA with n in ax and LBA in bx to the
	;; segment:address stored in es:cx
	push bp
	mov bp, sp
	sub sp, 8
	mov [bp-2], ax
	mov [bp-4], bx
	mov [bp-6], cx
	mov word [bp-8], MAX_READ_ATTEMPTS

.read_loop:
	;; Lets read data from the drive. There are at maximum 5 attempts to
	;; read, so that the motor has enough time to reach the correct speed.
	;; Knowing how a floppy is made up really helps understanding the
	;; following code.
	;; Floppy disks had those thin magnet disks. Some disks were read- and
	;; write able and both sides and others only at one. Reading and writing
	;; to such a disk happens by the head over the disk, so a side of the
	;; is commonly referred the by the number of its head.
	;; Each disk is split in many circular magnet stripes. These are
	;; called tracks for one or two heads and cylinders for more heads.
	;; Furthermore a cylinder is split in several sectors, which are
	;; 1-indexed.
	;; For this bootloader a 3.5" High Density floppy with 1.44Mb and 80
	;; tracks/cylinders, each with 18 sectors of 512 bytes is simulated.
	mov ax, [bp-4]
	lbachs
	;; Read to es:[bp-6]
	mov bx, [bp-6]
	;; ch, cl and dh are already set from the call to the lbachs function
	mov dl, [BootDrive]
	;; Move 2 in ah and 1 in al
	mov ax, 0000001000000001b
	int 0x13
	jnc .read_next_sector
	dec word [bp-8]
	jnz .read_loop
	;; Enter an endless loop if reading wasn't successful in the fifth try.
	mov si, ReadError
	call print_error

.read_next_sector:
	dec word [bp-2]
	;; Finish if no sectors are remaining
	jz .read_done
	inc word [bp-4]
	mov ax, [SectorSize]
	add [bp-6], ax
	mov word [bp-8], MAX_READ_ATTEMPTS
	jmp .read_loop

.read_done:
	add sp, 8
	pop bp
	ret
{% endhighlight %}

Now one or more continuous sectors can be loaded. This is suitable for loading a
single cluster. But a file may be distributed over multiple clusters. And these
clusters may not be stored in a continuous chain. This is called fragmentation.
To gather all the sectors of a file one has to follow the cluster chain of the
file in the file allocation table.

The entry of the current cluster in the file allocation table contains either
the index of the next cluster in the chain or a special marker indicating that
this cluster is the last one in the cluster chain of the file.

{% highlight nasm %}
%macro getNextCluster 0
	;; Get the next cluster for the cluster in ax
	;; Saves the next cluster in ax.
	mov cx, ax
	mov dx, ax
	;; The current cluster is now in ax, cx and dx
	;; Divide ax by two
	shr     ax, 1
	;; The cluster size in FAT12 is 12 bits, 3/2 bytes. The next cluster
	;; is the FAT pointer + 3/2 the current cluster.
	add     cx, ax
	mov     bx, [FatPointer]
	add     bx, cx
	;; Read two bytes
	mov     ax, [bx]
	;; Test if even or odd cluster number and extract the 12 bits of the
	;; cluster.
	test    dx, 1
	jnz     %%odd_cluster

%%even_cluster:
	;; Get the least significant 12 bits.
	and ax, 0111111111111b
	jmp %%done

%%odd_cluster:
	;; Shift ax 4 bits right to get the 12 most significant bits.
	shr ax, 4
%%done:
%endmacro
{% endhighlight %}

With that information an actual file can be loaded cluster by cluster from the
drive.

{% highlight nasm %}
load_file:
	;; This function loads a file with the starting cluster in ax to the
	;; address stored in bx.
	push bp
	mov bp, sp
	sub sp, 4

	mov [bp-2], ax
	mov [bp-4], bx

.load_file_loop:
	mov ax, [bp-2]
	cluster2LBA

	;; Read cluster into memory
	mov bx, ax
	xor ax, ax
	mov al, [SectorsPerCluster]
	mov cx, [bp-4]
	call readsectors

	;; Increase the file pointer by the size of a cluster
	xor ax, ax
	mov al, [SectorsPerCluster]
	mov cx, [SectorSize]
	mul cx
	add [bp-4], ax

	mov ax, [bp-2]
	getNextCluster
	mov [bp-2], ax
	;; Test for the special "end of file" marker
	cmp ax, 0xFFF
	jne .load_file_loop

	add sp, 4
	pop bp
	ret
{% endhighlight %}

I one point the bootloader was almost finished, however I could not load a file
larger than one sector. This bothered me for several weeks. One night I woke up
at 3 AM and just knew what the bug was. I got up, turned on my PC, quickly typed
my solution and went back to sleep. Two hours later I got up again and went to
work. The whole day I got more and more excited to see whether my solution
actually worked and was so happy in the evening to know that I finally finished
my bootloader.

In the end my problem was that I had not increased the pointer to the buffer for
the file to load by the size of one cluster, but by a single byte.

#### Load the root directory table

To process the root directory table, it first needs to be loaded into the
memory. To load the root directory table into memory, its location has to be
known. The root directory table is located right after to reserved boot
sector(s) and the file allocation table(s).

The information needed to calculate the start address of the root directory
table can be gathered from the BIOS parameter block.

The formula for the first sector of the root directory table is:

![RootStartSector = NumberOfFats * SectorsPerFat + ReservedForBoot]({{ "assets/sibolo/root_start_sector.svg" | absolute_url }})

 And the size of the root directory table in sectors can be calculated with:

![RootSize = (NumberOfRootDirEntrys * EntrySize) / SectorSize]({{ "assets/sibolo/root_dir_size.svg" | absolute_url }})

#### Processing a root directory table entry

Each entry starts with the filename in the 8.3 format. That means 8 bytes for
the name and 3 bytes for the file extension. If the name is shorter than 8
bytes, the rest is padded with spaces.

Processing such an entry is easy, just compare the first 11 bytes of the entry
with the name of the file the bootloader loads.

If both are equal, the file can be loaded and control passed to it. Switching
to the loaded file happens trough a far jump that changes the code segment
register **cs** to the segment the file is loaded to.

``` nasm
process_entry:
	;; This function processes an entry of the root directory table with its
	;; address in ax and loads the file describe by the entry if the name
	;; matches the 8.3 name stored in FileName.
	mov cx, 11
	mov si, ax
	mov di, FileName
	repe cmpsb
	je .pass_control
	ret

.pass_control:
	;; The si register holds the address of the root directory table entry
	;; of the file to load + 11
	;; The address of the first cluster of the file to load is the address
	;; of the root directory table entry + 26
	;; [si+15] holds the first cluster.
	mov ax, [si+15]
	mov bx, FILE_SEGMENT
	;; Load to FILE_SEGMENT:0
	mov es, bx
	xor bx, bx
	call load_file
	;; Pass the boot drive to the next stage.
	mov dl, [BootDrive]
	;; Far jump to the next stage
	jmp FILE_SEGMENT:0
```

At this point the task of the bootloader is done. The full source code with all
the given pieces put together is available in the GitLab repository
[kalehmann/SiBoLo](https://gitlab.com/kalehmann/SiBoLo).

### Installation on a drive

The bootloader comes with a little C program for the installation on a drive.

### Example usage

Setting up the bootloader to load a program, such as my
[Pong from scratch]({% post_url 2016-07-13-pong %})
is pretty straightforward.

#### Building the project

First the bootloader and its installer have to be build. This can be done using
the makefile of the project. Note that **nasm** and **gcc** have to be installed
to build te project.

#### Creating an floppy image

Creating a floppy image can be done using the _mkfs.fat_ utility. The following
command creates a new FAT12 image named _floppy.flp_ with a size of 1.44 MB.

``` bash
mkfs.fat -C floppy.flp 1440
```

To copy files onto the image, it needs to be mounted first. And to mount a
regular file under Linux, a loop device has to be associated with it.
_losetup_ is the tool of choice for this task. The following commands assume
that the pong binary has already been build and copied to the projects
directory.

``` bash
LOOP_DEV=$(losetup -f)
losetup ${LOOP_DEV} floppy.flp
mount ${LOOP_DEV} /mnt
cp PONG.BIN /mnt/
umount /mnt
```

#### Using the installer

The bootloader gets written on the floppy image with the supplied installer.
The installer takes 3 arguments in the following order:

- the bootloader binary
- the floppy image to write the bootloader onto
- the name of the file the bootloader should load

Note that the name of the file that the bootloader loads needs to comply with
the 8.3 format. The length of the base name must not exceed 8 bytes and the
length of the file extension must not exceed 3 bytes. All letters must be
upper case.

```
./sibolo-install bootloader.bin floppy.flp PONG.BIN
```

#### Test with qemu

The QEMU PC System emulator can be used to test the created floppy. The `-fda`
option tells qemu to use the following file as floppy.

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -fda floppy.flp
```
