In the autumn of 2018, I traveled together with 9 other students and two
teachers from our school – the BSZET in Dresden – to Columbus, Ohio.
This was an amazing trip for me, I also wrote about it here on my blog, see
[School exchange to Columbus, Ohio]({% post_url 2018-09-19-school-exchange-columbus-ohio %}).  
Now, a year later I still like remember this trip every once in a while
and I in retrospect I think I can still write that this experience and all the
lasting memories to it helped me to grow as a person and left me positively
impressed.

While our part was mostly over, after we arrived back in Germany and went to
school and work again, the project was not just an on-off initiative. Now,
almost a year after our trip to the USA, a group from the Columbus State
Community College arrived in Dresden. The city and especially our school
welcomed 10 students and 6 teachers from overseas. Thanks to the English teacher
of the first year of my apprenticeship, I had the chance to participate in the
project for a second time and accompany our visitors in Dresden.

They stayed for 10 days in a hostel near the main station and were accompanied
by 10 students and some teachers from the German school. During this short one
and a half week, the group did many trips and excursions in and around Dresden,
for example to the Saxon Switzerland.  But as this was a school project, of
course we had some tasks and educational trips. The subject was the same as last
year in the US. We visited multiple manufacturing sites in and around Dresden
and spend one afternoon visiting officials of the city to promote the project.

The first company we visited was the porcelain manufactory in Meißen. There we
got a short tour showing how the porcelain is sculpted and painted by hand.
After that we looked around in the exhibition of the manufactory. They had some
really cool and detailed exhibits there. Another point of great interest
especially for the American students and teachers was the age of the
manufactory. It is older than the United States Declaration of Independence.
After leaving the factory, our group walked through the city of Meißen to the
athedral and we had another tour there which also lead us to the roof of the
cathedral. From up there you have a wonderful view of Meißen and the surrounding
regions.

For our next company visit we split up into two groups. One group visited the
SUSA S. Sauer GmbH & Co. KG in Heidenau and the other group – including me –
visited König and Bauer in Radebeul. The company is a manufacturer for printing
machines. My enthusiasm about the visit remained fairly limited since I am more
interested in the IT. If I ever feel interested in mechanical engineering I
probably just fixed something with WD40 or duct tape. However I think the
Americans really enjoyed it and payed great attention the tour through the
vocational training center of the company, since that is not something you see
every day in the US.

The third company visit – this time as a whole group again – was Theegarten
Pactec in Dresden. The company is a big player in the field of manufacturing
technology. The company presented itself in a really interesting way. The guy
giving us a presentation was some kind of salesman and doing this for a few
centuries already. The presentation of him was correspondingly good and in my
opinion the best of the three companies we visited. After the presentation we
had a demonstration of a machine packaging sweets and after that we could try
to package a piece of candy by our self according to a template.

On our second Thursday we visited our fourth and final company - this time BMW
in Leipzig. While the tour was mostly an advertisement on how eco friendly BMW is
now (only green energy used, parts of the manufactoring side are made out of
wood, no welding used...) the tour was nevertheless really worhtwhile, in
particular seeing the high level automation there.

Last year in Columbus we visited to city hall hoping for a change to present
the project to the mayor of the city and make him sponsor the project in the
next years. While we had no luck meeting mister Andrew Ginther the project still
continued this year and we were more successful meeting mister Hilbert, the
mayor of Dresden. On the rainy afternoon of the second weeks Monday we visited
the city hall of Dresden and after a short waiting time and a tour through the
building we finally had an audience with the mayor. The audience itself only
lasted about 15 minutes and consisted of two short speeches from the mayor Mr
Hilbert and Paul Carringer, one of the US teachers, as well as a short speech of
thanks from two of the US students. In the end the US delegation handed the key
to the city of Columbus over to Mr Hilbert. Jokingly Paul Carringer guaranteed,
it can open the door of every bar in Columbus.

But lets put the official program aside. What was the most important thing for
the American and German students in this week? Meeting each other and making
new friends of course!  
Everyday, after the official part we still gone out in the city together, went
to some bars or just stayed together in the hostel and talked or watched some
movies together or played some board or card games. During the Sunday of the
second week we had no official program and some of us used the free day to drive
to the Lake Senftenberg, rented a boat there and enjoyed the day on the water.
Also exploring the city was really interesting for me, even as a German student.
I think in this short period of time I learned more about Dresden and discovered
more new places than in the past two years I lived here.

As a part of the school project connected with the student exchange we also had
to write some texts about the week and differences between Germany and the USA.  
I did my work in the form of a blog, that documented the student exchange like a
diary. You can take a look at it at
[schuelerraustausch.de](https://schuelerraustausch.de).

While I will finish my apprenticeship next summer and leave the school, I hope
this project will continue for many more years and many more students can enjoy
the experience.
